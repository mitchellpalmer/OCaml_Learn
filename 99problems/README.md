These are my solutions to the 99 Problems in OCaml from https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html

Unless otherwise noted, these are the solutions I developed before looking at the answers. They
might therefore not be the most optimal solutions.

I also haven't done all of the problems. I'm still working my way through them. Some I
chose not to do as they seemed to cover old ground.
