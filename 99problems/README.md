These are my solutions to the 99 Problems in OCaml from https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html

Unless otherwise noted, these are the solutions I developed before looking at the answers. They
might therefore not be the most optimal solutions.

I also haven't done all of the problems. I attempted to maximise coverage without taking too much
time.
